# 2D platformer SunnyLand

This is a sample project to demonstrate the coding abilities in C#
In this project, I tried to practice some essential elements in a normal 2D platformer, they are:

1. Better 2D control including coyote time, jump buffering and vaiable jump height, etc. (Relative codes at: Assets/Scripts/PlayerScript/PlayerControl & PlayerMain)
2. Player interaction with items and mobs (Relative codes at: Assets/Scripts/ItemScript & Assets/Scripts/EnemyScript)
3. Animation & Audio (Relative codes at: Assets/Scripts/PlayerScript/PlayerAnimation)
4. Parallax background (Relative codes at: Assets/Scripts/EnvironmentScript)
6. Game managers UIs (Relative codes at: Assets/Scripts/UIScript & Assets/Scripts/ManagerScript)

On top of those elements, everything are done while trying to keep the code more maintainable and modulus, instead of just mimicking the desired features.
