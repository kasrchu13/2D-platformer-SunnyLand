# 2D platformer SunnyLand

This is a sample project to demonstrate the coding abilities in C#
In this project, I tried to practice some essential elements in a normal 2D platformer, they are:

1. Better 2D control including coyote time, jump buffering and vaiable jump height, etc.
2. Player interaction with items and mobs
3. Scenes changing with some UIs
4. Parallax background
6. Animation

On top of those elements, everything are done while trying to keep the code more maintainable and modulus, instead of just mimicking the desired features.
