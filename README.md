# 2D platformer SunnyLand

This is a sample project to demonstrate the coding abilities in C#
In this project, I tried to practice some essential elements in a normal 2D platformer, they are:

1. Better 2D control including coyote time, jump buffering and vaiable jump height, etc.   (Assets/Scripts/PlayerScript/PlayerControl & PlayerMain)
2. Player interaction with items and mobs   (Assets/Scripts/ItemScript & Assets/Scripts/EnemyScript)
3. Animation & Audio (Relative codes at:   (Assets/Scripts/PlayerScript/PlayerAnimation & Assets/Scripts/ManagerScript/AudioManager)
4. Parallax background (Relative codes at:   (Assets/Scripts/EnvironmentScript)
6. Game managers UIs (Relative codes at:   (Assets/Scripts/UIScript & Assets/Scripts/ManagerScript/GameManager)
